# About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Brendan, a Mechatronics Engineering student from the University of Waterloo.

## Expertise

My main focus lies in the realm of machine learning and computer vision development. I love working with Python and have hands-on experience with popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and Isaac Gym. These technologies have allowed me to explore and create innovative solutions in the fields of AI and computer vision. (Check them out on my website https://bchharaw.github.io/#/)

Additionally, I have ventured into the realm of embedded development, where I've honed my skills with C/C++. This experience has given me the ability to build efficient and robust systems that interact with the physical world.

Moreover, I have dabbled in front-end technologies, becoming familiar with React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and the art of creating captivating user interfaces.

Not to mention, I'm well-versed in CAD design using tools like Fusion360, SolidWorks, and AutoCAD, enabling me to bring my ideas to life in the virtual world.

## Contact

I'm always excited to collaborate on interesting projects or answer any questions. Feel free to drop me an email at brendancmechatronics@gmail.com
