# About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Brendan, a Mechatronics Engineering student from the University of Waterloo.

## Expertise

My main focus lies in the realm of machine learning and computer vision development. I love working with Python and have hands-on experience with popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and Isaac Gym. Check out on my website at https://bchharaw.github.io/#/

I have ventured into the realm of embedded development (C/C++) and dabbled in front-end technologies (React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS).

## Contact

I'm always excited to collaborate on interesting projects or answer any questions. Feel free to drop me an email at brendancmechatronics@gmail.com
